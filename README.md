# Setup

Helps speeding up my workstation setup by running `~/setup.sh`.

## Still TODO

- Install Chrome / Chromium extensions (it's hard)
- Set system defaults
  - Dark theme
  - Dock auto-hide + bottom
  - Disable terminal bell
  - Terminal shortcuts
  - System keyboard shortcuts
  - Gnome Extensions / Tweaks (Yaru-dark shell)
- Chromium as Snap with keepass integration (https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc-browser/issues/405)
